# How We Work

We utilize both Discord & Trello to keep everyone on the same page. We don’t have any real meetings (voice calls) but there may be small discussions once in a while in the appropriate channels.

There are two Trello boards to keep track of the development board & the ideas board. The ideas board is self-explanatory, it's a board where you can add any of your ideas for the game. Feel free to also add ideas you personally like from <b>#suggestions</b> to this board.

The development board is used to keep track of all of the tasks to be completed that week. You’ll use this board to see what you need to work on & what the current state of the project is.
