# Expectations & General Responsibilities

As a developer @ Neighbors, we expect you to be fully responsible for your work. As we are a small team, every contribution to the game is significant and noticeable.

Other expectations include:
Being communicative. This means keeping everyone updated on your work, any problems you’re facing, etc. If you are out sick for example, please let your manager know as soon as possible.
Making sure your work is high quality & to the best of your ability. Don’t send in half-assed work.
Being on time & diligent.
