# Process
On Monday, the task board should be repopulated with new tasks. You can find tasks assigned to you by looking inside the to-do list and seeing which ones have your profile picture attached to them.

On the same day, your manager will tell you what you should work on & prioritize. You can view additional information about the task by clicking on the task card. 

You should now follow the process:

!!! example end "Steps to take"
    * When you want to start working on a task, move the card (the task) to the In-Progress list. 
        * Make sure you start the timer inside the card so that your time can be accounted for. Stop the timer when you are taking a break or no longer working on the task.
        
    * Once you’re finished with the task, move the card to QA and notify your manager that you’re finished. 

    * Go to #tester-chat and tag the testers. Your task will be tested by QA for any bugs and/or tweaks to be made.

    * Let them know if there are any specific things you want to be tested.

    * Work closely with QA and make sure any issues are resolved.

    * When the task is fully tested and shown to be bug-free, move it to Completed.

    * Follow the process above for each task assigned to you.
